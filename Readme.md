# CNN vs QNN Comparison Project

## Overview
This project compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) on image classification tasks. The goal is to understand how both models perform in terms of accuracy, loss, and training time.

## Visual Results
The results of the comparison are presented through several graphs. Below are the images along with explanations:

### 1. Comparison of QNN and CNN Performance
